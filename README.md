# qr-wedding-card


This script helped me a lot, when facing a time constraint, preparing my weeding, I was in need to generate to the fly invitation card for my guess.

I used a python script that read an Excel file, and generate on the fly some QR Code with all needed information to identify guess and direct them toward 
the table reserved for them

All credit goes to @MaitreWaff.

Run the script

# python ./qrCodeGenerator.py
